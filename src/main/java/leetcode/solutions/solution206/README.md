# [206. Reverse Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)

Given the `head` of a sorted linked list, reverse the list, and return _the reversed list_.

## Example 1

```md
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]
```

## Example 2

```md
1 -> 2
2 -> 1
Input: head = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]
```

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 5000]`.
- -5000 <= `Node.val` <= 5000

## Follow Up

A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?
