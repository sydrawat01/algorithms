# [83. Remove Duplicates from a Sorted List](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-list/)

Given the `head` of a sorted linked list, _delete all duplicates such that each element appears only once_. Return _the linked list __sorted__ as well_.

## Example 1

```md
Input: head = [1,1,2]
Output: [1,2]
```

## Example 2

```md
Input: head = [1,1,2,3,3]
Output: [1,2,3]
```

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 300]`.
- -100 <= `Node.val` <= 100
- The list is guaranteed to be __sorted__ in ascending order.
